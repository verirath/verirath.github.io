            <h2>Short Description</h2>
            <p>This was a project with a colleague of mine. The goal was to design an app and in-ferry monitors that are cruising through Stockholm.</p>

            <p>We also provided an overview of all the ferry lines for the user to pick</p>

            <p>If the line has some delay the time is displayed in red</p>
            <img src="../assets/images/StockholmFerris/StockholmFerris-LineWithDelay.png" alt="Stockholm Ferris delay">
            <p>It is also possible for the user to check other departures from certain stations</p>

            <p>Since this app is also for tourists we wanted to add some facts and sightseeing points for each stop.</p>

            <p>And if someone has feedback we provided a contact page.</p>

            <h2>Screens for ferry monitors</h2>
            <p>Every line has its own design to match the colors in the app. Moreover, the light grey circle was the last stop and the other ones are the following stops. <br>
                If there are departures from a certain stop the number of the line in the corresponding color are shown underneath the circles. <br>
                Again for the tourists there is a “Good to Know” part on the screen so they have some facts about the stop they are approaching.</p>
